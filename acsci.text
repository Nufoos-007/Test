GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It's used for hosting code, collaborating on projects, tracking changes, and managing software development. It enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts, facilitating code sharing, bug tracking, and project management through features like pull requests, issues, and wikis.
